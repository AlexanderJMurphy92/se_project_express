# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project aims to develop a robust server for the WTWR application. Throughout this project, I have enhanced my skills in database management, security implementation, testing, error handling, and deploying web applications on remote servers. My ultimate objective is to build a server that supports a comprehensive API and user authentication.

## Poject Description

The server is designed to manage various functionalities of the WTWR application, including the storage and retrieval of clothing items based on weather conditions, user data management, and facilitating user interactions such as liking items. The goal is to create a secure and reliable API that seamlessly integrates with the front end to deliver a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: Utilized for building the server, leveraging its asynchronous capabilities to efficiently handle multiple requests.
- Express.js: Employed as the web application framework to develop the API, enabling quick and flexible route management.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user and clothing item data, providing a scalable solution for managing document collections.
- Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, used to define data schemas and simplify database operations.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Implemented for user authentication, ensuring secure access and modification of resources by authorized users only.
- ESLint and Prettier: Configured to enforce consistent code style and quality across the project.
- GitHub Actions: Integrated for continuous integration, automatically running tests and code style checks with each commit to maintain code integrity.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
